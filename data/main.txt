This description is intentionally made very long to test whether the program handles overflow or trimming correctly when users input more than 200 characters. The description should not break the program or crash it, but instead follow COBOL's PIC clause restrictions.

This is a very long description entered to exceed the maximum 200 characters. It should trigger the description length limit message and still allow the job posting to be completed without program crash. The system must handle this correctly.
